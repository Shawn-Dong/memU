"""The inject seam's instruction: does patching a user's AGENTS.md stay safe?

The target file belongs to the *host*, not to memU, and may already hold a user's
own global instructions. These pin the three properties that protect it: existing
content survives, a re-run does not stack a second copy, and a changed
:data:`INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE` upgrades in place rather than appending a stale twin.

The second half pins the split: on a host with skills the procedure lives in a
skill and the instruction file gets a pointer; on a host without one, nothing
about today's behaviour moves.
