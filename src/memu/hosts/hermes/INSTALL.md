# Install memU for Hermes Agent

> **Audience: the agent.** A user will point you at this file ("follow this guide
> to install memU"). Work top to bottom. Each part ends with a **verify** gate —

Installing memU on Hermes is three parts:

1. **Install memU** — a Python package, and the store + provider it writes to.
2. **Register the bridging task** — the scheduled job that turns recent Hermes
   sessions into durable memory (the *record* seam).
3. **Patch `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`** — a standing instruction that tells the agent to
   pull relevant memory before answering (the *inject* seam).

Parts 2 and 3 must share one store and one embedding space, or a query is
compared against vectors written elsewhere and retrieval silently returns
nothing. Part 1 is what makes them agree.

**Scope note.** This adapter reads Hermes's SQLite session store —
`~/.hermes/state.db` (the `sessions` and `messages` tables), opened read-only so
it never contends with the gateway's writer. If this install runs a non-default
home (`HERMES_HOME`, or a profile), pass `--session-dir <home>/state.db` to
`prepare`. The manual snapshots under `~/.hermes/sessions/saved/` are not mined.

---

## Part 1 — Install memU

```
pip install memu-cli
```

This puts `memu` and **`memu-hermes`** on `PATH`. Confirm: `memu-hermes --help`.
If it is not found, fix `PATH` now — the scheduled task in Part 2 runs from a
bare, non-interactive environment.

### 1.2 Configure the store and provider

memU needs a **database** and an **LLM/embedding provider**. Both seams read this
one config. If another memU host adapter is already set up on this machine,
`~/.memu/config.env` exists and **must be reused as is**; skip to the verify
gate. Otherwise collect from the user:

| Setting | Env var | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | `MEMU_DB` | `~/.memu/memu.sqlite3`, or a `postgres://…` DSN |
| Embedding provider | `MEMU_EMBED_PROVIDER` | `openai`, `jina`, `voyage`, … |
| API key | `MEMU_API_KEY` | the key, or the name of an env var holding it |

**No `MEMU_API_KEY`? Say so, then go local.** If the user has no API key to
give, tell them up front what that means: memory cannot be called across
devices — everything stays on this machine, in a local database created for
them (SQLite, e.g. `~/.memu/memu.sqlite3`). Then configure exactly that: keep
`MEMU_EMBED_PROVIDER=openai`, point `MEMU_BASE_URL` at a local
OpenAI-compatible embedding server (e.g. Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1`
with `MEMU_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text`), and set `MEMU_API_KEY` to any
placeholder value — a local server ignores it.

**Shell proxies: nothing to ask.** If `doctor` fails with a **502** against a
local embedding server, a proxy is hijacking localhost traffic. The proxy may
come from the shell's `HTTP_PROXY` — or from the OS's system-wide settings
(macOS: System Settings → Network → Proxies;
Windows and Linux have equivalents — typically turned on by a proxy client of
the kind marketed as a VPN, e.g. Clash or Surge; a plain WireGuard/OpenVPN
tunnel does not set it), which `env | grep -i proxy`
will not show. Current memU bypasses proxies for loopback URLs automatically; on an
older release, set `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1` for the commands that call
memU. A local server reached through a **non-loopback** address
(`host.docker.internal`, a LAN IP, a WSL or VM host address) needs the
`NO_PROXY` exemption on every release, with that address in the list. This is
a mechanical requirement with exactly one right answer — apply it and move on;
do not ask the user.

Write them to **`~/.memu/config.env`** (absolute `MEMU_DB` path, `chmod 600`,
never a shell-profile export — the scheduled task does not inherit your shell).

### ✅ Verify Part 1

```
memu-hermes doctor
```

Must exit cleanly. Zero hits on the smoke-test retrieval is expected on a new
store.

---

## Part 2 — Register the bridging (record) task

The *record* seam: a scheduled job that mines recent sessions out of
`~/.hermes/state.db` into durable memU memory, skills, and resources. **Do not
reinvent this** — follow the packaged procedure:

```
memu-hermes docs task
```

In summary: settle a schedule with the user (default: every hour) and
register a recurring headless Hermes run — via system cron invoking `hermes`
non-interactively with the prompt that document gives you verbatim — that runs
`memu-hermes prepare`, works through `~/.memu/hosts/hermes/jobs/*.txt` in order,
then `memu-hermes commit`. Nothing in it is machine-specific.

### ✅ Verify Part 2

Confirm the cron entry exists, then dry-run: `memu-hermes prepare` (zero prepared
sessions is fine and correct when nothing is new).

---

## Part 3 — Patch `~/.hermes/SOUL.md` with the retrieval instruction

The *inject* seam: a standing instruction in Hermes's **SOUL.md** telling the
agent to pull relevant memory before answering. SOUL.md is the one file Hermes
loads from `HERMES_HOME` into every session regardless of working directory, so
the instruction is simply always there. (Project-level `.hermes.md`/`AGENTS.md`
files would miss sessions started elsewhere.)

**Do not hand-write the instruction.** memU owns the text and installs it:

```
memu-hermes install-instruction
```

It writes memU's block into `~/.hermes/SOUL.md`, creating the file if absent, and
prints the diff. It appends rather than overwrites (existing content is backed up
to `SOUL.md.bak`), and it is idempotent: the text sits in a marked block that a
re-run — or a later memU release — replaces in place. `--dry-run` shows the diff
without writing; `--path` targets a non-default home or profile.

### ✅ Verify Part 3

```
cat ~/.hermes/SOUL.md
memu-hermes retrieve "smoke test"
```

The memU block must appear exactly once, prior content intact, and `retrieve`
must exit cleanly (empty lists are fine). A fresh Hermes session picks up the new
SOUL.md.

---

## Done

Report back to the user: the store and provider in use; the scheduled job and its
schedule in words; and that the retrieval instruction is now in
`~/.hermes/SOUL.md`, taking effect next session. Record and inject both read
`~/.memu/config.env`, so they provably share one store.
