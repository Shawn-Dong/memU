# Uninstall memU for Codex

> **Audience: the agent.** A user has pointed you at this file ("follow this
> guide to uninstall memU"). Work top to bottom. Each part ends with a
> **verify** gate — do not proceed until the current one passes.

Uninstalling is the install run in reverse, and it is three parts:

1. **Unregister the bridging task** — stop the scheduled job first, so nothing
   fires mid-teardown (the *record* seam).
2. **Unpatch `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`** — remove the standing retrieval
   instruction (the *inject* seam).
3. **Apply the data-and-package defaults** — the user's memory is kept, the
   tooling is removed — and close by reporting both.

**One store, many hosts.** `~/.memu/config.env` and the store it names may be
shared by other memU host adapters on this machine (`memu-claude-code`,
`memu-cursor`, …). Removing *this* host's seams never requires touching the
shared store; Part 3 spells out when touching it is safe at all.

## Part 1 — Unregister the bridging (record) task

Find the Codex scheduled task that runs the memU bridging pipeline — it was
created at install time (named e.g. `memu-bridging`) with the three-step
prepare / self-evolve / commit prompt — and delete **that task only**, through
the same scheduled-task surface Codex used to create it. Any other scheduled
tasks the user has are theirs and stay.

### ✅ Verify Part 1

Codex's scheduled-task list no longer shows a memU bridging task.

---

## Part 2 — Remove the retrieval instruction

**Do not hand-edit the block out.** memU owns the text and removes it for you:

```
memu-codex remove-instruction
```

It deletes memU's marked block from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` and prints the diff.
Everything outside the markers is the user's and survives; the previous
contents are backed up to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md.bak` before the rewrite.
`--dry-run` shows the diff without writing. Re-running is a clean no-op — a
file with no block left is already the desired end state.

### ✅ Verify Part 2

`cat ~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — no `memu:begin`/`memu:end` markers remain, and the
user's own content is intact. The session you are working in already loaded
the old file, so the instruction may still be in your own context; a fresh
session is what picks the removal up.

---

## Part 3 — The data, the config, and the package (defaults, then report)

No questions to ask here. Apply the defaults below, and make sure the final
report tells the user plainly what they got: **memory kept, tooling removed.**
Only one thing overrides a default: the user's own explicit words.

- **Keep the store and `~/.memu/config.env`.** Always. The store *is* the
  user's accumulated memory, and it survives an uninstall by design —
  reinstalling later picks it right back up. Delete it only if the user
  explicitly asked to erase their memory as part of this uninstall, and warn
  first, in plain words, that it is irreversible.
- **The session cursor lives and dies with the store.** The `.session_manifest*` files
  directly under `~/.memu/`
  records which session turns have already been mined *into that store*. Store
  kept (the default)? Keep the cursor — deleting it loses no memory, but the
  next install re-mines every old session for nothing. Store deleted at the
  user's request? Delete the cursor with it — a surviving cursor over an empty
  store marks history as already mined, and it would never be mined again.
- **Remove this host's residue.** Codex predates the per-host layout, so its
  run-scoped state sits directly under `~/.memu/`: the `jobs/`, `memory/`,
  `skill/`, and `resources/` directories — but **not** the `.session_manifest*`
  cursor files (see above). **Never** sweep `~/.memu/` wholesale to get them —
  `config.env`, the store file, and the cursor live there too. Also
  `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` itself **if** Part 2
  left it empty (it held only memU's block, so the install created it) — a
  file with the user's own content stays, of course.
- **Uninstall the package** — `pip uninstall memu-cli` (or `pipx uninstall
  memu-cli` — match how it was installed) — **unless** another host adapter is
  still integrated on this machine (another host's instruction file still
  carries a memU block, or its bridging task still exists). Then the package
  stays, and the report says which host is still using it.

### ✅ Done

Close the report with the two things the user needs to hear, in this order:

1. **What was kept:** their memory — the store at `MEMU_DB`,
   `~/.memu/config.env`, and the session cursor — untouched. A later reinstall
   picks it up as is and resumes mining right where it left off.
2. **What was removed:** the bridging schedule, the retrieval instruction,
   this host's working state, and (unless another host still needs it) the
   `memu-cli` package.
