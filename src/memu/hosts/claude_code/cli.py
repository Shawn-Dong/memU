"""``memu-claude-code`` — the Claude Code host adapter's command-line surface.

The verbs are the shared host-adapter surface (:mod:`memu.hosts.host_cli`); this
module is the Claude Code declaration: where its sessions live, and which file
its standing instruction lands in.

Usage:
    memu-claude-code retrieve "<query>"    # the inject seam — what the agent runs each turn
    memu-claude-code install-instruction   # the inject seam — patch ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md to run it
    memu-claude-code prepare               # slice new sessions into job files
    memu-claude-code verify-resources      # filter the touched-file log (run by a job)
    memu-claude-code commit                # submit what the agent produced back to memU
    memu-claude-code doctor                # check config + store before relying on them
    memu-claude-code docs install          # print the agent-facing install guide
